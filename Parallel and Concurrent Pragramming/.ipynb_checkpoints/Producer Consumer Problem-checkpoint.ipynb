    "1. Since the Queue has a Condition and that condition has its Lock we don't need to bother about Condition and Lock. Producer uses Queue.put(item[, block[, timeout]]) to insert data in the queue. It has the logic to acquire the lock before inserting data in queue. If optional args block is true and timeout is None (the default), block if necessary until a free slot is available. If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds and raises the Full exception if no free slot was available within that time. Otherwise (block is false), put an item on the queue if a free slot is immediately available, else raise the Full exception (timeout is ignored in that case).\n",
    "2. Also put() checks whether the queue is full, then it calls wait() internally and so producer starts waiting.\n",
