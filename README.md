## Want to contribute?
<!-- Follow the following steps:

### 1. Fork the project repository
Find the project's repository on GitHub, and then "fork" it by clicking the Fork button in the upper right corner:

This creates a copy of the project repository in your GitHub account. In the upper left corner, you will see that you are now looking at a repository in your account:
{username}/Python-Exrercises

### 2. Clone your fork
While still in your repository, click the green Clone or download button and then copy the HTTPS URL:
Using Git on your local machine, clone your fork using the URL you just copied: git clone URL_OF_FORK.

For example, git clone https://github.com/{username}/Python-Exercises.git.

Cloning copies the repository files (and commit history) from GitHub to your local machine. The repository will be downloaded into a subdirectory of your working directory, and the subdirectory will have the same name as the repository. -->
